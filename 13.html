             <p>Navinder Singh Sarao, a stock trader who operated out of his bedroom in west London, had wreaked havoc in markets when his fake trades helped trigger a sudden $1 trillion stock market crash. The 'flash crash' in value across the major stock market indexes lasted 36 minutes in May 2010, as per a CNBC report.Navinder Sarao learned to trade in an arcade above a supermarket after applying to a newspaper ad in 2003. From nothing, he built a bankroll of millions of dollars, buying and selling S&P 500 futures while wearing a tracksuit and a pair of red, heavy-duty ear defenders to block out sound.

             <p> His most extravagant purchase was a secondhand Volkswagen.

           <p> The program, which allowed Sarao to place and then cancel huge orders, tricking high frequency traders' firmsâ€™ algorithms, proved wildly effective: On his most successful day, Sarao made more than $4 million. But it also destabilised markets, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, including on the already volatile day of the Flash Crash.
